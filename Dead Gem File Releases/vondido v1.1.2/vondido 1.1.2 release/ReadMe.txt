Dead Gem: NYC V1.1.2

   First off, I WILL TRY MY BEST TO MAKE SURE THAT EACH LEVEL IS 100% BEATABLE.  I have recorded my times for each of the current levels.

Level 1 - 25 seconds

F2: Starts a New Game

Person: The little stick figure is you.  Move around by using the Arrow Keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).

Gems: These are the pink items, that look like diamonds or jewels.  You must collect all of these to pass to the next level.

Keys: There is usually only one key in each level, and along with the gems, you must have the key to pass to the next level.

Snakes: These are bad.  Each time you hit a snake you lose a life and restart the level.

Lives: You have 3 lives.  If you die three times, that's a Game Over and you will be sent back to the first level of the game.

   I know there is still a whole ton of work left for me to do in the programming aspect of this game, but for now this is pretty much a "trial" version.  It was completely my own unique idea, and the name was also a very lucky coincidence.  I hope you enjoy this "trial" version, and I hope to be realeasing an actual realease some time before December, although I can't promise anything, as it takes a very long time to create each unique level.  As I make more levels they are going to need to get harder, so it will take a bit longer.  Hopefully, if I have enough time, I can start making the levels 20 by 20 versus the current 10 by 10.  Thank You for tring my game, and have a nice day!
